2. Yes the recursion example uses tail recursion
3. Created an account on Argent & Bravos . 

And the differences between an Ethereum EOA and Starknet account is as follows :

- Ownership: In Ethereum, an EOA is owned by an individual user who has control over the private key associated with the account. In contrast, a StarkNet account is owned by a smart contract deployed on the StarkNet network.

- Functionality: EOAs on Ethereum are used for sending and receiving transactions, executing smart contract functions, and interacting with decentralized applications. StarkNet accounts are used primarily for executing layer 2 computations and storing the results of these computations on the StarkNet network.

- Fees: On Ethereum, transaction fees are paid by the user who initiates the transaction using their EOA. In contrast, on StarkNet, computation fees are paid by the smart contract owner whose contract is executing on the network.

- Interoperability: EOAs on Ethereum are compatible with a wide range of wallets, exchanges, and other dApps on the Ethereum network. In contrast, StarkNet accounts are specific to the StarkNet network and its ecosystem.
