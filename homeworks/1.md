## Modular Arithmetic

1. If S is a group with p = 7 and has elements from 0 to 6 ( p - 1 = 7 - 1 = 6 ), 
then 
```
4 + 4 = 8 mod 7 = 1
3 x 5 = 15 mod 7 = 1
Fermat's theorem says that a^-1 = a^(p-2) mod p
3^-1 = 3^(7-2) mod 7 = 3^5 mod 7 = 243 mod 7 = 5 which belongs to G
```

2. Yes

3. 

```
-13 mod 5 
= ( 2 - 15 ) mod 5
= 2mod5 - 15mod5
= 2 mod 5 - 0
= 2 mod 5  
```

4. x = 2 is a root. third degree polynomial
