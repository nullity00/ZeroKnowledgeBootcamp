1. 

```
Odd squares
9 mod 8 = 1
25 mod 8 = 1
49 mod 8 = 1
81 mod 8 = 1
121 mod 8 = 1
```

```
Even squares
4 mod 8 = 4
16 mod 8 = 0
36 mod 8 = 4
64 mod 8 = 0
100 mod 8 = 4
144 mod 8 = 0
```

3. O(n) would iterate n times for n input, O(1) would iterate once for every input, O(log n) would vary as per the log size of input
